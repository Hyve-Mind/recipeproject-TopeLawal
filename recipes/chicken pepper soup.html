    <h2>Sometimes, a comforting bowl of chicken soup is all you need.</h2>
    <p>Nigerian Chicken Pepper Soup is an easy and hearty comfort food very popular in West Africa. It is also known as African Pepper soup, and as the name implies 'Pepper Soup' is a hot and spicy chicken broth recipe made with a blend of aromatic African spices. I promise you, this is the only chicken Pepper soup recipe you will need so let me show you how to make it in easy steps.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg chicken</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground ehu (calabash nutmeg)</li>
        <li>3 small seasoning cubes (chicken flavour)</li>
        <li>Scent leaves</li>
        <li>Habanero pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>Sweet pepper or tatashe</li>
        <li>Red onions</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the pieces of chicken in a pot.</li>
        <li>Add thyme, ground ehu and the seasoning cubes (crushed).</li>
        <li>Turn on the heat to medium and start steaming while stirring till the pieces of chicken have gotten a good steam.</li>
        <li>Add the chunks of onion, pour water to cover the contents of the pot, cover and start cooking till the chicken is soft. Top up the water when necessary while cooking.</li>
        <li>When the chicken is done, take out the now deflated chunks of onion. The reason we used chunks of onion is because you don't want pieces of onion in your Nigerian Pepper Soup.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped peppers and vegetables.</li>
        <li>Leave to boil for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add salt to your taste and that's it!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Best Served with boiled white rice</p>
