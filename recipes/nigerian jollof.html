    <h2>Parties without Jollof Rice is that one even a party? </h2>
    <p>Jollof rice is enjoyed by the majority of the African countries, especially Nigeria and this recipe I'm sharing is mostly used by Nigerians. We refer to it as Nigerian Jollof Rice. l don't think there's any Nigerian home and abroad who doesn't like Jollof Rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups long bismati Rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 big onions</li>
        <li>240 grams tomato paste</li>
        <li>4-5 redball pepper (tatashe)</li>
        <li>4 medium-size tomatoes/ one can chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 pieces Scotch bonnet pepper (Atarodo) or more if yours is not hot</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken/beef stock</li>
        <li>1 small seize ginger</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>50 grams butter/margarine</li>
        <li>3-4 pieces bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon thyme</li>
        <li>8 cubes seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place your cooking pot on medium heat, add the vegetable oil, the diced onions, the tomato paste, and bay leaves. Fry them together for about 2 minutes until they become translucent. (do not stop stirring to avoid burning)</li>
        <li>Add your blended ingredients (Tomatoes, scotch bonnet pepper, garlic, onions, and red ball pepper) and stir well.</li>
        <li>Allow to cook for about 5 minutes, stir well and go ahead to add your chicken/beef stock and stir well.</li>
        <li>Add spices (curry, thyme, salt, seasoning, and margarine) Then cover to cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Open and stir very well, then go ahead to add the washed rice, and stir well in the mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil paper, reduce the heat, and allow to cook for the first 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 20 minutes, open and taste for salt, if it still requires more add, and cover to cook for another 20-25 minutes.</li>
        <li>At this juncture, the rice should be soft and tender. Stir well to the bottom of the pot with a knife or turning stick ( I prefer knife, sometimes the turning stick breaks the rice in the process of turning)</li>
        <li>Cover and increase the heat for about 5 minutes and allow the rice to burn for the authentic Jollof party taste.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and turn again to the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, your smoky party Jollof Rice is ready.</li>
        <li>Enjoy while still warm with any chilled drink of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
