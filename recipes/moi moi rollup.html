    <h2>What are weekends without moi moi??</h2>
    <p>Moi-moi rollup (baked beans pudding roulade) is basically moi-moi, baked and rolled up. The traditional ways of making moimoi is to wrap in a leaf and steam.</p>

    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup of Peeled beans</li>
        <li>1 Red bell pepper (Divided)</li>
        <li>2 Onion (divided)</li>
        <li>1 Habanero (Rodo)</li>
        <li>1 Cooked egg (sliced)</li>
        <li>1 Raw egg (optional)</li>
        <li>Cooked fish</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3/4 Water</li>
        <li>Green onion for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the peeled` beans in water overnight or for a few hours, for easy blending. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Remove the pepper stalks and rinse. Blend the soaked beans and blend with half of the red bell pepper, habanero, and half of an onion bulb, blend until you have a smooth paste. You can blend the beans first then when you almost get a smooth paste you can add the peppers and the onions. Or add everything together and blend. Stop your blender in between while blending.</li>
        <li>In a shallow and large bowl, mix the vegetable oil and egg together, if you're not using a raw egg just add the vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>When you are done with the blending, pour the beans mixture into a bowl, add oil, and mix as you would mix cake to incorporate air into the mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the salt and seasoning cube, onions, and mix.</li>
        <li>Pour half of the chopped onion and red bell pepper into the beans batter, and continue to mix. Add water ( I used 3/4 of measuring cup) and continue to mix.</li>
        <li>Check for the seasoning and adjust accordingly.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. (I used both because I was making it ahead and left it in the oven when I was done, so I used a little of the foil underneath the parchment paper)</li>
        <li>If you're using aluminum foil only remember to grease it with oil or cooking spray to avoid sticking.  Make sure you have an excess of the foil or parchment paper at the edge of the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Pour the beans batter into the foil or the parchment paper and spread it out to reach all the edges of the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Spread the cooked fish, remaining onions, green onion, and the sliced eggs over the mixture.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining red bell pepper over it to give some color.</li>
        <li>Place in the preheated oven (don't cover) and bake for 15 minutes, the time might slightly vary because of the oven capacity. Check if it's done by inserting a toothpick and if it comes out clean it's done. You can even know by mere looking at it or touching the surface.</li>
        <li>Start from one side of the baking sheet edge by lifting the excess of the parchment and roll inward, continue rolling until you get to the end.</li>
        <li>Let it rest so you can have it intact before you cut it.</li>
        <li>Cut it up and serve.</li>
    </ol>
